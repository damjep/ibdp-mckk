Apart from the academic support, the school also support my interest and needs, as such I was sent to attend a conference in Singapore and presented the findings of my research. Such exposure is valuable to me and my CV. Apart from that, it also helps me to secure an internship at my university as a research assistant."

The programme is carefully created in order to develop various skills, and this actually forces us (students) to venture outside of our comfort zone. It is also important to note that the DP actually believes that everyone should contribute back to the society and CAS is helping us in doing that. A good institution such as MCKK is a great place to achieve the main purpose of IB Diploma as it offers great facilities and teaching staffs to help students in completing two years of great experience."

Due to the unique Melbourne Model initiative, I have taken the opportunity to study Computing and Programming as my elective subject and Marketing as my breadth subject. What IB taught me the most is to be a lifelong knowledge seeker and a persistent risk-taker. While the options are diverse, students are tempted to take an easy elective or breadth subject that can increase their CGPA (or Weighted Average Marks (WAM) at my university). What I did is to be out of my comfort zone and study subjects that are unique and new to me. Programming and computing literacy is very important in every academic discipline. With this realization and the experience that I gained from my IB years, I start to learn my first coding language and hoping in the near future to further understand and integrate the power of big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of Psychology and Marketing. What I hope is that the future IB students will be willing to study subjects that are not just industry related, but what also excites them. In my opinion, the satisfaction of not knowing while learning new things is far more satisfying than being comforted by the high-scored grades during our study."
